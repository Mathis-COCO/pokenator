# Pokinator Frontend

## Requirements

- Docker
- having the [backend](https://gitlab.com/pauloducap/pokinator) already running

## How to run

- clone the project
- at the root of the cloned project: `docker compose up`

> Project will start by default on port 3000.

## Some potentiel future improvements

- accessibility
- prevent the main page from responding when a pop up is open
- refactoring the way we handle languages
- more settings
- cleaner settings pop up
- better way for the user to know when a pokemon has been found (probably a summary showing the number of questions that have been asked and other informations)
- authentication
